## Current Project Status
![Current Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php)

This project currently lives in a **alpha status**.  Our current release is not production ready; it has been created in order to receive feedback from the community. \
As long as this project is in alpha status, things may and probably will break once in a while.  \
We aim to provide backward compatibility (without any guarantee) even for alpha releases, however the library will raise notices indicating breaking changes and what to do about them. \
If you don't want these notices to appear or change the error message level, you can do so by calling:
```php
OpenTelemetry\SDK\Common\Dev\Compatibility\Util::setErrorLevel(0)
``` 
to turn messages off completely, or (for example)
```php
OpenTelemetry\SDK\Common\Dev\Compatibility\Util::setErrorLevel(E_USER_DEPRECATED)
``` 
to trigger only deprecation notices. Valid error levels are `0` (none), `E_USER_DEPRECATED`, `E_USER_NOTICE`, `E_USER_WARNING` and `E_USER_ERROR`  \
However (as long as in alpha) it is safer to pin a dependency on the library to a specific version and/or make the adjustments 
mentioned in the provided messages, since doing otherwise may break things completely for you in the future!

There is a supplemental repository for OpenTelemetry PHP contributions that are not part of the core 
distribution of the library. Typically, these contributions are vendor specific receivers/exporters and/or 
components that are only useful to a relatively small number of users.  This repository can be found
[here.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php-contrib/)

---

We attempt to keep the [OpenTelemetry Specification Matrix](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/spec-compliance-matrix.md) up to date in order to show which features are available and which have not yet been implemented.  

If you find an inconsistency in the data in the matrix vs. the data in this repository, please let us know in our slack channel and we'll get it rectified.

## Requirements
The library requires a PHP version of 7.4.x, 8.0.x or 8.1.x

### Dependencies

---

#### REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES
#### 1) Install PSR17/18 implementations

The library has a dependency on both a [HTTP Factories (PSR17)](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/)
and a [php-http/async-client](https://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/clients.html) implementation.
You can find appropriate composer packages implementing given standards on [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/).
Follow [this link](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-factory-implementation) to find a `PSR17 (HTTP factories)` implementation,
and [this link](https://packagist.org/providers/php-http/async-client-implementation) to find a `php-http/async-client` implementation.

---

#### OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES

#### 1) Install PHP [ext-grpc](https://pecl.php.net/package/gRPC)

**The PHP gRPC extension is only needed, if you want to use the OTLP GRPC Exporter.**

Three ways to install the gRPC extension are described below. Keep in mind, that whatever way
to install the extension you choose, the compilation can take up to 10-15 minutes. (As an alternative you can search for
a pre-compiled extension binary for your OS and PHP version, or you might be lucky and the package manager of your OS
provides a package for the extension)
- **Installation with pecl installer** (which should come with your PHP installation):

```bash
[sudo] pecl install grpc
```

- **Installation with pickle installer** (which you can find [here](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/pickle)):

```bash
[sudo] pickle install grpc
```
- **Manually compiling the extension**, which is not really complicated either, but you should know
  what you are doing, so we won't cover it here.

> Notice: The artifact of the gRPC extension can be as large as 100mb (!!!), Some 'hacks' to reduce that size,
>are mentioned [in this thread](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/23626). **Use at your own risk.**

#### 2) Install PHP [ext-mbstring](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php)

The library will load the `symfony/polyfill-mbstring` package, but for better performance you should install
the  PHP mbstring extension. You can use the same install methods as described for the gRPC extension above,
however most OS` package managers provide a package for the extension.

#### 3) Install PHP [ext-zlib](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.zlib.php)

In order to use compression in HTTP requests you should install
the  PHP zlib extension. You can use the same install methods as described for the gRPC extension above,
however most OS` package managers provide a package for the extension.

#### 4) Install PHP [ext-ffi](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ffi.php)

_Experimental_ support for using fibers in PHP 8.1 for Context storage requires the `ffi` extension, and can
be enabled by setting the `OTEL_PHP_FIBERS_ENABLED` environment variable to a truthy value (`1`, `true`, `on`).

Using fibers with non-`CLI` SAPIs may require preloading of bindings. One way to achieve this is setting [`ffi.preload`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ffi.configuration.php#ini.ffi.preload) to `src/Context/fiber/zend_observer_fiber.h` and setting [`opcache.preload`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/opcache.preloading.php) to `vendor/autoload.php`.

#### 5) Install PHP [ext-protobuf](https://pecl.php.net/package/protobuf)

**The PHP protobuf extension is optional when using either the `OTLPHttp` or `OTLPGrpc` exporters.**

The protobuf extension makes both exporters more performant. _Note that protobuf 3.20.0+ is required for php 8.1 support_

---

## Installation
The recommended way to install the library is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

1)  Install the composer package using [Composer's installation instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intromd#installation-linux-unix-macos).


2)  Add
```bash
 "minimum-stability": "dev"
```

To your project's `composer.json` file, as this utility has not reached a stable release status yet.

3) Install the dependency with composer:

```bash
$ composer require open-telemetry/opentelemetry
```

## Development
For repeatability and consistency across different operating systems, we use the [3 Musketeers pattern](https://3musketeers.io/). If you're on Windows, it might be a good idea to use Git bash for following the steps below.

**Note: After cloning the repository, copy `.env.dist` to `.env`.** 

Skipping the step above would result in a "`The "PHP_USER" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string`" warning

We use `docker` and `docker-compose` to perform a lot of our static analysis and testing. If you're planning to develop for this library, it'll help to install `docker engine` and `docker-compose`.

The installation instructions for these tools are [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/), under the `Docker Engine` and `Docker Compose` submenus respectively.

To ensure you have all the correct packages installed locally in your dev environment, you can run

```bash
make install
```

This will install all the library dependencies to
the `/vendor` directory.

To update these dependencies, you can run

```bash
make update
```



## Pull Requests

To propose changes to the codebase, you need to [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the opentelemetry-php project.

After you open the pull request, the CI will run all the associated [github actions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/actions/workflows/php.yml).

To ensure your PR doesn't emit a failure with GitHub actions, it's recommended that you run important the CI
tests locally with the following command:

```bash
make all
```
This does the following things:

* Installs/updates all the required dependencies for the project
* Uses [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) to style your code using our style preferences.
* Runs all of our [phpunit](https://phpunit.de/) unit tests.
* Performs static analysis with [Phan](https://github.com/phan/phan), [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/) and [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/getting-started)

### Other PHP versions

We aim to support officially supported PHP versions, according to https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php. The developer image `ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/opentelemetry-php-base` is tagged as `7.4`, `8.0` and `8.1` respectively, with `7.4` being the default.
You can execute the test suite against other PHP versions by running the following command:

```bash
PHP_VERSION=8.0 make all
#or
PHP_VERSION=8.1 make all
```

## Proto Generation
Our protobuf files are committed to the repository into the `/proto` folder.  These are used in gRPC connections to the
upstream.  These get updated when the [opentelemetry-proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto)
repo has a meaningful update.  The maintainer SIG is discussing a way to make this more automatic in the future.

To generate protobuf files for use with this repository, you can run the following command:

```bash
make protobuf
```

This will replace `proto/otel/Opentelemetry` and `proto/otel/GPBMetadata` with freshly generated code based on the latest
tag from `opentelemetry-proto`, which can then be committed.


## Semantic Conventions Generation
Autogenerated semantic convention files are committed to the repository in the `/src/SemConv` directory. These files
get updated when new version of [opentelemetry-specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification)
released.

```bash
SEMCONV_VERSION=1.8.0 make semconv
```

Run this command in the root of this repository.

## Styling
We use [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) for our code linting and standards fixer.  The associated configuration for this standards fixer can be found in the root of the repository [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/blob/master/.php_cs)

To ensure that your code follows our coding standards, you can run:
```bash
make style
```
This command executes a required test that also runs during CI. This process performs the required fixes and prints them out.
Code that doesn't meet the style pattern will emit a failure with GitHub actions.

## Static Analysis
We use [Phan](https://github.com/phan/phan/) for static analysis.  Currently, our phan configuration is just a standard default analysis configuration.  You can use our phan docker wrapper to easily perform static analysis on your changes.

To run Phan, one can run the following command:
```bash
make phan
```
This process will return 0 on success.
Usually this process is performed as part of a code checkin.  This process runs during CI and is a required check.  Code that doesn't match the standards that we have defined in our [phan config](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/blob/master/.phan/config.php) will emit a failure in CI.

We also use [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/) as a second static analysis tool.  
You can use our psalm docker wrapper to easily perform static analysis on your changes.

To run Psalm, one can run the following command:
```bash
make psalm
```
This process will return 0 on success. Usually this process is performed as part of a code checkin. This process runs during CI and is a required check. Code that doesn't match the standards that we have defined in our [psalm config](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/blob/main/psalm.xml.dist) will emit a failure in CI.

We use [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) as our third tool for static analysis.
You can use our PHPStan docker wrapper to easily perform static analysis on your changes.

To perform static analysis with PHPStan run:
```bash
make phpstan
```
This process will return 0 on success. Usually this process is
performed as part of a code checkin. This process runs during CI and is a required check. Code that doesn't match the
standards that we have defined in
our [PHPStan config](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-php/blob/main/phpstan.neon.dist) will emit a failure
in CI.

## Testing
To make sure the tests in this repo work as you expect, you can use the included docker test wrapper.  
To run the test suite, execute
```bash
make test
```
This will output the test output as well as a test coverage analysis (text + html - see `tests/coverage/html`).  Code that doesn't pass our currently defined tests will emit a failure in CI

## PhpMetrics
To generate a report showing a variety of metrics for the library and its classes, you can run:
```bash
make phpmetrics
```
This will generate a HTML PhpMetrics report in the `var/metrics` directory. Make sure to run `make test` before to create the test log-file, used by the metrics report.

## Examples

### Trace
You can use the [examples/AlwaysOnZipkinExample.php](/examples/AlwaysOnZipkinExample.php) file to test out the reference implementation we have for zipkin.  This example performs a sample trace with a grouping of 5 spans and POSTs the result to a local zipkin instance.

You can also use the [examples/AlwaysOnJaegerExample.php](/examples/AlwaysOnJaegerExample.php) file to test out the reference implementation we have for Jaeger.  This example performs a sample trace with a grouping of 5 spans and POSTs the result to a local Jaeger instance.


If you'd like a no-fuss way to test this out with docker and docker-compose, you can perform the following simple steps:

1)  Install the necessary dependencies by running `make install`. 
2)  Execute the example trace using `make trace examples`.

Exported spans can be seen in zipkin at [http://127.0.0.1:9411](http://127.0.0.1:9411)

Exported spans can also be seen in jaeger at [http://127.0.0.1:16686](http://127.0.0.1:16686)

### Metrics
You can use the [examples/prometheus/PrometheusMetricsExample.php](/examples/prometheus/PrometheusMetricsExample.php) file to test out the reference implementation we have. This example will create a counter that will be scraped by local Prometheus instance.

The easy way to test the example out with docker and docker-compose is:

1) Run `make metrics-prometheus-example`. Make sure that local ports 8080, 6379 and 9090 are available.

2) Open local Prometheus instance: http://localhost:9090

3) Go to Graph section, type "opentelemetry_prometheus_counter" in the search field or select it in the dropdown menu. You will see the counter value. Every other time you run `make metrics-prometheus-example` will increment the counter but remember that Prometheus scrapes values once in 10 seconds.

4) In order to stop docker containers for this example just run `make stop-prometheus`
