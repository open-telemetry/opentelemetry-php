# Upgrading notes for major versions

## 1.x -> 2.x

### SDK

#### SDK\Registry removed
`SDK\Registry` has been removed, and the technique of registering components (eg propagators, transports,
auto-instrumentations) has been replaced with [Nevay/SPI](https://github.com/Nevay/spi/) ServiceLoader.

The ServiceLoader should be configured through existing `_register.php` files, which should *only* contain calls to
SPI's `ServiceLoader::register()` method.

SPI has a composer plugin which will scan for `ServiceLoader::register()` calls in `autoload.files` and generate a
`GeneratedServiceProviderData.php` file in `vendor/composer/`. The plugin will then remove those `autoload.files` entries
from composer's generated output to avoid double-loading.
Pre-generating the services in this way avoids a race-condition in 1.x where composer's `autoload.files` are executed in an
undefined order, and services may not be registered in time for the SDK to use them.

For SPI to work correctly, the composer plugin _should_ be allowed to run. If the plugin is not allowed to run, then
services will still register at runtime, however this might still suffer from the same race-condition as `1.x`.

#### FactoryInterfaces updated
Various component factory interfaces (eg `TextMapPropagatorFactoryInterface`, `TransportFactoryInterface`) have been
updated to include `priority()` and `type()` methods. These are used in conjunction with SPI ServiceLoader to associate
a type (eg `otlp`) with a factory, and to allow SDK-provided factories to be replaced by user-provided factories (by
providing a higher priority for the same type).

#### Metrics: InstrumentType, Temporality, advisory
Methods which previously accepted `Temporality|string`, or `InstrumentType|string` no longer accept strings.
`$advisory` is now a required parameter for `OpenTelemetry\SDK\Metrics\DefaultAggregationProviderInterface`.

If the SDK is configured via autoloading (using environment variables or declarative (yaml) config), the default temporality
is `Cumulative` for all instruments, per [spec](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.48.0/specification/metrics/sdk_exporters/otlp.md#general).
This can be changed by setting the temporality preference via `OTEL_METRIC_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE` environment variable. Possible
values are `cumulative`, `delta`, or `lowmemory`.

If the SDK is configured programmatically, an exporter should be configured with an `AggregationTemporalitySelectorInterface`.
The SDK-provided implementations are `AggregationTemporalitySelector::alwaysCumulative()`, `::deltaPreferred()`,
and `::lowMemory()`. The default selector is cumulative.

#### TracerProvider
`TracerProvider` constructor now accepts a `SpanProcessorInterface` as the first argument, rather than an array of
`SpanProcessorInterface`s. If multiple processors are required, they should be added to a `MultiSpanProcessor` (which
is what happened internally in 1.x anyway).
