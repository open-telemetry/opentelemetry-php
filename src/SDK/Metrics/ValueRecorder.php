/*
 * Name	: ValueRecorder
 * Instrument kind : Synchronous
 * Function(argument) : record(value)
 * Default aggregation : MinMaxSumCount
 * Notes : Per-request, any non-additive measurement
 *
 * ValueRecorder is a non-additive synchronous instrument useful for
 * recording any non-additive number, positive or negative. Values
 * captured by a Record(value) are treated as individual events
 * belonging to a distribution that is being summarized. ValueRecorder
 * should be chosen either when capturing measurements that do not
 * contribute meaningfully to a sum, or when capturing numbers that
 * are additive in nature, but where the distribution of individual
 * increments is considered interesting.
 *
 * Example: One of the most common uses for ValueRecorder is to capture latency
 * measurements. Latency measurements are not additive in the sense that
 * there is little need to know the latency-sum of all processed requests.
 * We use a ValueRecorder instrument to capture latency measurements
 * typically because we are interested in knowing mean, median, and other
 * summary statistics about individual events.
 *
 * The default aggregation for ValueRecorder computes the minimum and maximum
 * values, the sum of event values, and the count of events, allowing the rate,
 * the mean, and range of input values to be monitored.
