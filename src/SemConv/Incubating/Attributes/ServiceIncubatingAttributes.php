     * The string ID of the service instance.

     * MUST be unique for each instance of the same `service.namespace,service.name` pair (in other words
     * `service.namespace,service.name,service.instance.id` triplet MUST be globally unique). The ID helps to
     * distinguish instances of the same service that exist at the same time (e.g. instances of a horizontally scaled
     * service).
     *
     * Implementations, such as SDKs, are recommended to generate a random Version 1 or Version 4 [RFC
     * 4122](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) UUID, but are free to use an inherent unique ID as the source of
     * this value if stability is desirable. In that case, the ID SHOULD be used as source of a UUID Version 5 and
     * SHOULD use the following UUID as the namespace: `4d63009a-8d0f-11ee-aad7-4c796ed8e320`.
     *
     * UUIDs are typically recommended, as only an opaque value for the purposes of identifying a service instance is
     * needed. Similar to what can be seen in the man page for the
     * [`/etc/machine-id`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/machine-id.html) file, the underlying
     * data, such as pod name and namespace should be treated as confidential, being the user's choice to expose it
     * or not via another resource attribute.
     *
     * For applications running behind an application server (like unicorn), we do not recommend using one identifier
     * for all processes participating in the application. Instead, it's recommended each division (e.g. a worker
     * thread in unicorn) to have its own instance.id.
     *
     * It's not recommended for a Collector to set `service.instance.id` if it can't unambiguously determine the
     * service instance that is generating that telemetry. For instance, creating an UUID based on `pod.name` will
     * likely be wrong, as the Collector might not know from which container within that pod the telemetry originated.
     * However, Collectors can set the `service.instance.id` if they can unambiguously determine the service instance
     * for that telemetry. This is typically the case for scraping receivers, as they know the target address and
     * port.
