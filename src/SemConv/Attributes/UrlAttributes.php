     * Absolute URL describing a network resource according to [RFC3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986)
     * For network calls, URL usually has `scheme://host[:port][path][?query][#fragment]` format, where the fragment
     * is not transmitted over HTTP, but if it is known, it SHOULD be included nevertheless.
     *
     * `url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`.
     * In such case username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.
     *
     * `url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed).
     *
     * Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.
     *
     *
     * Query string values for the following keys SHOULD be redacted by default and replaced by the
     * value `REDACTED`:
     *
     * - [`X-Amz-Signature`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv-authentication-methods.html)
     * - [`X-Amz-Credential`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv-authentication-methods.html)

     * points to one representative usage rather than an exhaustive list, and does not narrow
     * the scope of the key to the linked service or signing scheme.
     *
     * This list is subject to change over time.
     *
     * Matching of query parameter keys against the sensitive list SHOULD be case-sensitive.
     *
     *
     * Instrumentation MAY provide a way to override this list via declarative configuration.
     * If so, it SHOULD use the `sensitive_query_parameters` property
     * (an array of case-sensitive strings with minimum items 0) under
     * `.instrumentation/development.general.sanitization.url`.
     * This list is a full override of the default sensitive query parameter keys,
     * it is not a list of keys in addition to the defaults.
     *
     * When a query string value is redacted, the query string key SHOULD still be preserved, e.g.
