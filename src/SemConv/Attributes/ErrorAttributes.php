     * When `error.type` is set to a type (e.g., an exception type), its
     * canonical class name identifying the type within the artifact SHOULD be used.
     *
     * Instrumentations SHOULD document the list of errors they report.
     *
     * The cardinality of `error.type` within one instrumentation library SHOULD be low.
     * Telemetry consumers that aggregate data from multiple instrumentation libraries and applications
     * should be prepared for `error.type` to have high cardinality at query time when no
     * additional filters are applied.
     *
     * If the operation has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.
     *

     * it's RECOMMENDED to:
     *
     * - Use a domain-specific attribute
     * - Set `error.type` to capture all errors, regardless of whether they are defined within the domain-specific set or not.
